<h1 class="col-md-12 aboutme">About Me</h1>
<p class="col-md-9 bio">I grew up in New York and went to college at Cornell University.
<br></br>
After graduation, I headed south and took a job at Doner Advertising in Baltimore. I always meant to get back to New York but within a few years at Doner, I had a new boss, a better title and a fatter salary.
<br></br>
So I stayed.
<br></br>
During that time I won my first Andy and One Show awards.
<br></br>
Five years later, I was made Creative Director. Our department’s work appeared regularly in the CA Annual. My radio campaign for Milk was honored by CA three years running, won two CLIO awards and earned me a spot on Adweek's All-Stars. Pro bono campaigns for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and the Pratt Free Library were awarded a Gold and a Bronze Lion from Cannes.
<br></br>
In 2000, I was asked to join Doner’s Detroit headquarters as Executive Creative Director. There I created the long-running "Counting Sheep" campaign for Serta mattresses. I was also part of team that created Mazda’s "Zoom-Zoom" campaign, still the most recalled automotive theme of any car maker. My other clients over the last eight years have included online travel giants, Expedia and Hotels.com, along with Bush's Beans, Cox Communications, Lexmark, Arby's and Progressive Insurance. Along the way I’ve also had a hand in the creation of Mr. Six, the dancing octogenarian ambassador for Six Flags Amusement Parks. And just a few years back, the Serta Counting Sheep were inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame.
